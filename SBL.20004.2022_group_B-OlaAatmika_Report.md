## Introduction

Some words on the backgorund of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

Project: Metabolomics of 15 Gesneriaceae species 

Aim: We aim to perfrom metabolomics on Gesneriaceae family to find the medicinal bio-active substances


## Material & Methods

### Sample collection

- Where we the plants collected ? 
- Which species were collected ? 
- Link to the iNaturalist entries of your species.

You can link a csv that you upload on github.
Go to the export link of the DBGI project on inaturalist https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export?projects=digital-botanical-gardens-initiative
Apply eventual filters (fo rexample by username)
Save the csv and upload to github.

Sampling 
* We cut around 2 small leaves from each plant (15 plants)
* We put the samples in coffee filter and sealed them in ziplock bags
* We used silica gel for drying and kept them for 2 weeks.

Sample details:

Aeschynanthus radicans                      53 mg
Sinningia cardinalis                        51 mg
Sinningia leucotricha                       53 mg

### Sample preparation

A Solid Liquid extraction was performed to the dried samples using solvents mixure of Methanol : H2O : Formic Acid (80 : 20 : 0.1), We weighed ~ 50 mg of each sample and put it in a clean 2 ml eppendorf tubes, then 3 metal beads were put per sample tube in addition to one empty tube which was considered as a blank. the samples were completly freezed usin liquid nitrogen before crusing them with 
* We kept the tubes in liquid nitrogen to freeze them completly
* Crush the samples on Retsh system at 30 Hz for 3 mins
* Add 1.7 ml of Methanol : H2O : Formic Acid (80 : 20 : 0.1)
* Mix on Retzh system for another 3 mins at 30 Hz
* Centrifuge the samples at 14000 rpm for 3 mins
* Carefully take the supernatant (~ 1.3 ml) and transfer them to tubes and label them 
* Store them in -80 degrees 
*
