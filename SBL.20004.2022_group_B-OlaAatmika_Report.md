## Introduction

Some words on the backgorund of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

Project: Metabolomics of 15 Gesneriaceae species 

Aim: We aim to perfrom metabolomics on Gesneriaceae family to find the medicinal bio-active substances


## Material & Methods

### Sample collection

- Where we the plants collected ? 
- Which species were collected ? 
- Link to the iNaturalist entries of your species.

You can link a csv that you upload on github.
Go to the export link of the DBGI project on inaturalist https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export?projects=digital-botanical-gardens-initiative
Apply eventual filters (fo rexample by username)
Save the csv and upload to github.

Sampling 
* We cut around 2 small leaves from each plant (15 plants)
* We put the samples in coffee filter and sealed them in ziplock bags
* We used silica gel for drying and kept them for 2 weeks.

### Sample preparation

A Solid Liquid extraction was performed to the dried samples using solvents mixture of Methanol : H2O : Formic Acid (80 : 20 : 0.1). We weighed ~ 50 mg of each sample and put it in a clean 2 ml Eppendorf tubes, then 3 metal beads were put per sample tube, in addition to one empty tube which was considered as a blank. the samples were completely freezed using liquid nitrogen before grinding them with Retsch mixer mill at 30 Hz for 3 mins. 1.7 ml of Methanol : H2O : Formic Acid (80 : 20 : 0.1) were added to each tube, the samples were mixed with the solvent mixture for using Retsch mixer mill for 3 minutes at 30 Hz. We centrifuged the extracts at 14000 rpm for 3 mins, the supernatants (~ 1.3 ml) were transferred carefully to clean labelled glass vials, we covered the vials with slotted screw caps, and Stored them in -80Â° C degrees. 

### LCMS Analysis

The samples were injected on Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry system, the conditions are descibed on the following links

* MS conditions: https://github.com/commons-teaching/SBL.20004.2022_group_B-OlaAatmika/blob/1af71651b08b8a4b8029d96b7afd7f732b006d45/SBL.20004.2022_group_B-OlaAatmika_MS_conditions.txt
