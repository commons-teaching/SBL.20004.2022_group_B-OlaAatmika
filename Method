Project: Metabolomics of 15 Gesneriaceae species 

Aim: We aim to perfrom metabolomics on Gesneriaceae family to find the medicinal bio-active substances

Sampling 
* We cut around 2 small leaves from each plant (15 plants)
* We put the samples in coffee filter and sealed them in ziplock bags
* We used silica gel for drying and kept them for 2 weeks.

Aeschynanthus radicans                      53 mg
Sinningia cardinalis                        51 mg
Sinningia leucotricha                       53 mg
Kohleria digitaliflora                      50 mg

Sample Extraction:
* Solid Liquid extraction using MeOH. 
* We weighed the sample ~ 50 mg in the eppendorf tubes (15 + 1 blank)
* Put 3 metal beads per eppendorf
* We kept the tubes in liquid nitrogen to freeze them completly
* Crush the samples on Retsh system at 30 Hz for 3 mins
* Add 1.7 ml of Methanol : H2O : Formic Acid (80 : 20 : 0.1)
* Mix on Retzh system for another 3 mins at 30 Hz
* Centrifuge the samples at 14000 rpm for 3 mins
* Carefully take the supernatant (~ 1.3 ml) and transfer them to tubes and label them 
* Store them in -80 degrees
